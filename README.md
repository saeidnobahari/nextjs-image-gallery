An Image Gallery built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/) and [Chakra UI v1](https://next.chakra-ui.com/).


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Head over to https://www.pexels.com/api/new/ and create a new API key. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add the API key in it.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PEXELS_API_KEY = 
```

Install the dependencies by running the following command.

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
